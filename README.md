# teamfinderr

Why?
----

As graduates trying to get into tech, we often have ideas which we would like to implement but dont necessarily have all of the skills to do so. Unless you already know people who could fill the gaps, the learning curve can become so steep that implementing the idea seems like an impossible task.

  

What?
-----

Teamfinderr solves this problem by creating a network of skilled people that are ready and willing to collaborate on projects and help ideas come to fruition. The objective of teamfinderr is to enable our users to start their own ventures and find the necessary team members to succeed.

  

How?
----

We want to create an API for a database of users and projects/ideas. Users can create projects and then assemble teams from our pool of users.
